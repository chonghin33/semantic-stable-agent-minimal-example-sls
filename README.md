## Overview

Semantic Stable Agent (SSA) is a minimalistic, language-native AI agent designed based on the principles of the Semantic Logic System (SLS).  
It demonstrates how a closed-loop modular agent can operate purely through structured natural language, without external memory, plugins, or API reliance.

This project showcases how Layered Prompt Architectures (Meta Prompt Layering - MPL) and Intent Layer Structuring (ILS) can create long-term semantic stability for agents.

## Quick Start

1. Copy the [Semantic Stable Assistant v1.1 prompt](./Semantic_Stable_Assistant_v1.1.md).
2. Paste it into any capable LLM (ChatGPT-4 / Claude-Opus / etc.).
3. Begin interaction.  
   The agent will self-regulate tone, logic, and structure automatically.

## Why SSA?

- Native language-only agent architecture
- Internal semantic reflection and self-correction
- Sustainable tone, rhythm, and task continuity
- No memory or external function dependency

## Origin

SSA is an application example derived from the **Semantic Logic System (SLS)**,  
a modular semantic control framework authored by Vincent Shing Hin Chong.
